# Changelog

## Backlog

- [ ] Add a 'real' command line parser for `lib/cli.js` like minimist
- [ ] Deprecate Scrollex in favor of execa passing through to stdout/stderr
- [ ] Go over all `process.env.*` and make sure they are only at the head of `config.js`
- [ ] Hooks are ran with every build, but not when doing HMR. We might be able to hook into the asset manifest callback to work around this for assets, while lib/cli.js calls it for content (CAN DO, config.webpack.js contains a custom plugin example that shows this now)
- [ ] Make it so that you can only build e.g. a homepage via `LANYON_EXCLUDE=* LANYON_INCLUDE=home.html,_layouts/default.html`. However, we first need this Jekyll issue resolved: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/4791#issuecomment-289021488
- [ ] Throw an error if we find legacy Jekyll residu such as `./vendors` or `.bundle`
- [ ] Throw warning when not jekyll excluding: `- node_modules - .git`, like when you have `exclude: [vendor]` in your jekyll config
- [ ] Wait on https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin-cli/pull/11 and https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin/issues/226 and add image building from `assets/images` -> `assets/build/images`

## Next

Released: 2021-04-29
[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.3.4...v0.3.6).

Released: 2021-04-29
[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.28...v0.3.4).

- [x] Do not build Docker containers anymore by default (as Transloadit doesn not use them anymore. Too slow on macOS.)

[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.19...v0.2.20).

[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.18...v0.2.19).

[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.17...v0.2.18).

- [x] Set `cache:true` for HTML Plugin so asset references aren't written each time, triggering Jekyll builds for all pages that use them, which can be all of them.

## v0.2.17

Released: 2020-06-08
[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.16...v0.2.17).

- [x] Combine jQuery & Bootstrap window import rules
- [x] Combine file & url loaders where safely possible

## v0.2.16

## v0.2.15

Released: 2020-06-08

    ```js
    module.exports.overrideRuntime = ({ runtime, toolkit }) => {
      runtime.headAssetTemplate = ({ htmlWebpackPlugin }) => {
        return `${htmlWebpackPlugin.tags.headTags}`.replace(/"\/assets\//g, `"https://transloadit.edgly.net/assets/`)
      }
      runtime.bodyAssetTemplate = ({ htmlWebpackPlugin }) => {
        return `${htmlWebpackPlugin.tags.bodyTags}`.replace(/"\/assets\//g, `"https://transloadit.edgly.net/assets/`)
      }
    }
    ```

## v0.2.14

Released: 2020-06-08
[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.12...v0.2.14).

- [x] Fix bug: no longer reference `jekyll.lanyon_assets.yml`

## v0.2.13

Released: 2020-06-08
[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.12...v0.2.13).

- [x] Fix bug: No longer use cache-loader before MiniCssExtractPlugin, so that CSS assets exist in entrypoints, even when nothing changed
- [x] Switch from `AssetsPlugin` to `StatsWriterPlugin` /thx @goto-bus-stop
- [x] **BREAKING** Switch to `splitChunks`. This means entrypoints have multiple assets now
- [x] **BREAKING** Switch from `jekyll.lanyon_assets.yml` to `HtmlWebpackPlugin` which creates html snippets to easier load multiple assets per entrypoint. These files are written to `_includes/_generated_assets/`. To include, replace any occurance of `lanyon_assets`, with CSS: `{%include _generated_assets/app-{{jekyll.environment}}-head.html%}`, for JS: `{%include _generated_assets/app-{{jekyll.environment}}-body.html%}`. You'll first want to run a `build` before doing a `start` to prewarm the generated includes. It's recommended to commit the development assets, but git ignore production ones by adding `_includes/_generated_assets/*-production-*.html` to `.gitignore`

## v0.2.12

Released: 2020-06-08
[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.11...v0.2.12).

## v0.2.11

Released: 2020-06-08
[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.10...v0.2.11).

- [x] Add BundleAnalyzerPlugin. To use try e.g. `make build-assets-production && open _assets/build/report.html` inside your project (or: `LANYON_ENV=production npx lanyon build:assets && open _assets/build/report.html`)

## v0.2.10

Released: 2020-06-05
[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.9...v0.2.10).

- [x] Accumulate lanyon_assets rather than overwriting, because with caching, we sometimes only get passed JS assets, which effectively removes CSS asset references

## v0.2.9

Released: 2020-06-05
[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.8...v0.2.9).

- [x] Move back from `noParse: (content) => /jquery|lodash/.test(content),` because it results in `ReferenceError: require is not defined` for `_.get`

## v0.2.8

Released: 2020-06-05
[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.7...v0.2.8).

- [x] Move back from `eval-cheap-module-source-map` to `source-map` for production as it increased js builds by 15MB

## v0.2.7

Released: 2020-06-05
[Diff](https://github.com/kvz/lanyon/compare/v0.2.6...v0.2.7).

- [-] Add DllPlugin <https://webpack.js.org/plugins/dll-plugin/> <-- this requires several webpack calls and entry points using eachother, high hanging fruit
- [-] Use SplitChunksPlugin <https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#smaller--faster> <-- increases build time (as indicated in <https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#avoid-extra-optimization-steps>) and generates many more assets to include it seems, high hanging fruit
- [x] Add cache-loader <https://github.com/webpack-contrib/cache-loader/> in front of expensive non-babel loaders <-- as it has its own caching. Clear cache directory on `"postinstall"` in `package.json`.
- [x] Add cache-loader:babel `cacheDirectory: .lanyon`, `cacheCompression:false` on babel-loader <https://github.com/babel/babel-loader#options>
- [x] Limit fileset by making `include` as discrimating as can be
- [x] Make sure we set a `recordsPath` <https://webpack.js.org/configuration/other-options/#recordspath>
- [x] Minimize the number of items in `resolve.modules`, `resolve.extensions`, `resolve.mainFiles`, `resolve.descriptionFiles`, as they increase the number of filesystem calls.
- [x] No `Uglify`, `Terser`, `ExtractText`, `[hash]`, `[chunkhash]`, `AggressiveSplittingPlugin`, `AggressiveMergingPlugin`, `ModuleConcatenationPlugin` for dev mode. Set `uglifyOptions.compress: false` for prod.
- [x] Only use `ProgressPlugin` briefly, then remove
- [x] Set `module.noParse: (content) => /jquery|lodash/.test(content)` <https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#module-noparse>
- [x] Set `optimization: { removeAvailableModules: false, removeEmptyChunks: false, splitChunks: false, },` <https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#avoid-extra-optimization-steps>
- [x] Switch sourcemaps to `eval-cheap-module-source-map` <https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#devtool>
- [x] Use ThreadLoader <https://github.com/webpack-contrib/thread-loader>. For node-sass, set `workerParallelJobs: 2`. <-- gives errors for css but seems to work for js

## v0.2.6

Released: 2020-06-04
